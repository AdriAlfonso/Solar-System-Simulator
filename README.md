### Usage
This is a Unity 2021.3.21f1 project that simulates a fictional solar system with four planets: Ceres, Iris, Makemake, and Neptune. The orbital physics of the planets were designed using the laws of universal gravitation. To explore the solar system, you can control a spaceship and navigate through it. The spaceship's speed can be adjusted for comfortable exploration.

### Adding More Planets
To add more planets to the simulation, simply create a new GameObject in Unity and give it the "Celestial" tag. The Manager script will recognize the tag and add it to the list of celestial bodies to orbit.
